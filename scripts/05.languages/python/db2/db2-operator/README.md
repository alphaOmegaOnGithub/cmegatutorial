# db2-operator
An operator which can you to deploy db2 cluster on k8s.

## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against.
You can find details about how to set up k8s environment on <a href="../../k8s/README.md">k8s README</a>

### Running on the cluster
1. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG="129.69.209.196:5000/db2-operator:latest"
```
You can find details about how to create private docker registry on <a href="../docker-image-registry/README.md">registry README</a>
	
2. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG="129.69.209.196:5000/db2-operator:latest"
```
You can check that db2-operator is running in namespace **__db2-operator-system__**  

3. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f CR/db2_v1_db2cluster.yaml
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
